# Welcome to CodePlayList [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://ctt.ac/oJ342)


This repository contains links to songs/playlists/mix for programmers and coders to listen to when [wired in](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wired%20in) :)

We all love music in our own way. Psychological studies reveal that developers can slide into a focused working rhythm with music much faster than without. It helps to block out distractions around you. If you have being developing stuff and programming for quite sometime, then you would know how listening to music helps.

The goal of CodePlayList repo is to bring together people who listen to different types of music while coding and share it with the open source community. Developers can browser through [Links.md](https://github.com/ritvikkhanna09/CodePlayList/blob/master/Links.md) and even contribute the music they like.
